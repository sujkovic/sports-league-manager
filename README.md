# Sports League Managing Software Using C++

This program supports creating a league, players, and teams, in addition 
to signing/releasing players from teams, moving players between teams, and 
tracking their previously played for teams through the career command. This 
program uses dynamic arrays in order to make things a little more difficult 
for myself and get practice with dynamic memory and the big 3.
